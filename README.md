# 🎟️ Voucher Exchange Marketplace

A peer-to-peer platform that allows users to exchange unused digital vouchers with others who actually need them.

---

## 📌 Overview

Many users receive discount vouchers and coupons from platforms like Google Pay and other services but never end up using them. This project solves that problem by providing a **voucher exchange marketplace**, where users can list their unused vouchers and exchange them with other users instead of letting them expire.

The platform focuses on **fair exchange**, **user transparency**, and a **simple request-based workflow** rather than direct buying or selling.

## ✨ Key Features

* List unused vouchers with voucher codes
* Browse vouchers listed by other users
* Send exchange requests for vouchers you’re interested in
* View requester profiles and their listed vouchers
* Propose counter-exchanges
* Notification-based request and approval flow
* Automatic voucher ownership transfer after mutual acceptance

---

## 🔄 How the Exchange Works

1. A user lists an unused voucher on the platform.
2. Other users can browse available vouchers in the marketplace.
3. If User A likes a voucher listed by User B, User A sends an exchange request.
4. User B receives a notification and can view User A’s profile and listed vouchers.
5. User B requests a voucher from User A in exchange.
6. User A receives the exchange request and can accept or decline.
7. Once both users accept, ownership of the vouchers is exchanged between them.

This ensures a **mutual, consent-based exchange** without direct monetary transactions.
